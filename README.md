# LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS

Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) similarly to PCA, is well-known as a dimensionality reduction technique and for data classification. While PCA is usedful for **unsupervised learning** and mainly focuses on capturing maximize variation the data set, LDA works for **supervised learning** and focuses toward finding a feature subspace that maximizes the separability between the groups.

Learning LDA technique is needed for project the features in higher dimension space into a lower dimension space.
